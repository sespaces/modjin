# modjin

A transitional-phase set of human-utterable and human-comprehendable language constructs useful in creating a new human language. The idea is to make it easy and efficient to express and identify the subtleties of human experience in an enumerated form.

Modjin is to Mojilang (a hypothetical future human language) as pidgin is to any language being advanced towards.
