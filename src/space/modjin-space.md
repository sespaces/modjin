modjin treats space in three ways, depending on context, which mainly consists of dimensionality

for one-dimensional space, the origin is the self:
    forward or backward or right or left or up or down

for two-dimensional space, such as with the surface of the earth in cartography or with visual "screen" space

    as an expanding or contracting series of pentagonally-arranged, overlapping circles; 
    
    from one come six that are either: 
        
        the same as its own size, with itself as the center circle and the other five surrounding it
        
        shrunken in size such that the six cover the space of the original

    it divides/expands a circle into six new circles, with the centerpoint of the center circle remaining the same, and new centerpoints for the five new circles at predermined distances and angles from the original centerpoint

        for this reason, mapping space in modjin relies heavily on the use of the "ENU" (East, North, Up) coordinate system; once the first 12 coordinates for earth's surface are established, the coordinates for every lower level are iteratively related to those 12 positions

    The SESpaces Coordinate System specifies twelve points on the globe as "beads," or centerpoints for six regions each in the northern and southern hemispheres. 

    These regions 
    
for three-dimensional space, modjin utilizes six axes, each with an "in" and and "out"

    these are located at
