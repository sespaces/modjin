modjin treats space in three ways, depending on context, which mainly consists of dimensionality

for one-dimensional space, the origin is the self:
    forward or backward or right or left or up or down

for two-dimensional space, such as with the surface of the earth in cartography or with visual "screen" space

as an expanding or contracting series of pentagonally-arranged, overlapping circles;

from the original circle arise six that are either:

the same as its own size, with itself as the center circle and the other five surrounding it, expanding the covered area; or

shrunken in size, such that the six new circles account for the space of the original

whether expanding or contracting, the centerpoint of the original circle remains the same

##### new centerpoints
for the five new circles at predermined distances and angles from the original centerpoint

###### when expanding


###### when contracting

#### geographic
because each new centerpoint associated with a given expansion or contraction is relative to its antecedent centerpoint, cartography in modjin relies heavily on the use of the "ENU" (East, North, Up) coordinate system


The SEspaces Coordinate System specifies twelve points on the globe as "beads," or centerpoints for six regions each in the northern and southern hemispheres.

These regions are located at     




once the first 12 coordinates for earth's surface are established, the coordinates for every lower level are iteratively related to those 12 positions


###three-dimensional space,
modjin utilizes six axes, each with an "in" and an "out," or "-" and "+" in traditional terms
